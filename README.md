# JSON FS DB

Database split between folders and json files.

By introspecting on folder structure, JSON FS DB stores information where you
wanted it to go, crossing the boundary between filesystem and JSON.

## What it isn't

This is not a database that you would want to build and scale an app on.

## Why?

I want to manage data in a curated/decentralized way that uses github to manage
the source of truth. I would just write the data manually, but I would rather
be able to manipulate this data programmatically to make my life easier. This
database will make it easy to manage my data while still structuring the files
in a way that makes sense to me.
